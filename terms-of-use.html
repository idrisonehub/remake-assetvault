You should read these Terms of Use (this “Agreement”) carefully before using the Service. Access to and use of the Service is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, and your use of the Service signifies and constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, you should not use the Service. Provider may revise this Agreement from time to time.

                <div class="ordered-list-title">User Accounts</div>
                <p>To post information to and otherwise use the Service, you must first register by creating a User Account. User Account registration requires you to submit to Provider certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number, and other information. If you choose to set up your User Account to have the option to either be invoiced or electronically pay for certain fee-based Services at the Provider’s discretion , you will also be required to provide a valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You grant Provider the right to provide any information you submit to Provider to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of any monetary transactions initiated by you or on your behalf. You understand that your continued use of the Services following any trial period may result in charges to you for the Services (“Charges”). Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges are based on Services purchased and not actual usage and fees paid are non-refundable. Provider reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise the Charges to you for the Services for all or part of the Services at any time in Provider’s sole discretion. Provider will use reasonable efforts to inform you of such Charges and You may elect to cancel the Services rather than pay the Charges. You understand that your continued use of the Services following notice from Provider may result in charges to you for the Services and that Provider may terminate or suspend the Services until you have paid the Charges.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to our use of third parties to process monetary transactions (<em>e.g. </em>credit card transactions), we also have arrangements with vendors who provide us with certain hosting and data storage services (<em>e.g. </em>Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud storage). Those companies are provided (either by us or directly by you) with your information as part of the service for which they are hired. These companies are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services. We require these companies to maintain the&nbsp;confidentiality of the information they receive, and prohibit them from using the information for any other purpose.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access your User Account, and it is recommended that you choose a strong password, i.e., a password of sufficient length and complexity such that third parties will not readily guess your password. You should take measures to maintain and preserve the confidentiality of the username and password associated with your User Account, and you must notify Provider promptly of any unauthorized use or suspected breach of security of your User Account. Provider shall not be liable for any losses that may result from any unauthorized use of your User Account or failure to maintain appropriate confidentiality measures. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your User Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. Provider owns your User Account credentials and may revoke or change them at any time.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p>These Terms and the relationship between you and Provider will be governed by New Zealand law, and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand courts for any matter or dispute arising in relation to these Terms.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in force and effect.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <div class="ordered-list-title">Assignability</div>
                <p>Provider may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to an affiliated company or, in the event of a merger or acquisition of Provider or the sale of substantially all of Provider’s assets related to the services being provided to you, to the surviving or successor entity with reasonable notice to you. You may not assign this Agreement or the rights and obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Provider.&nbsp;<br></p>

              <li>
                <div class="ordered-list-title">Term Termination</div>
                <p>The term of this Agreement shall commence upon your first use of the Service, and shall continue (i) as long as you or any persons given access by you retain access rights to the Service, or (ii) until Provider ceases to operate the Service or closes your User Account. Provider shall not have any ongoing obligation to provide the Service; thus, Provider may cease to operate the Service at any time and for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing, Provider may cease to provide your User Account in the event of: (i) any dispute or termination of Provider’s relationship with you; (ii) any dispute concerning ownership or control of your User Account; or (iii) use of your User Account in a manner that Provider, in its sole discretion, considers improper or unacceptable. Provider reserves the right to limit the period of time during which Provider may make any User Content pertaining to you available on the Service. The Service should not be viewed as your backup, archival or storage service with respect to any User Content.&nbsp;<br></p>

              <li>
                <div class="ordered-list-title">Privacy Policy</div>
                <p>Any data that you provide to Provider using this Service is subject to the Privacy Policy that is posted on the Service and in effect at the time such data is provided. Provider may update its Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should be sure to review the Privacy Policy posted on the Service prior to providing any information to Provider using the Service. This Agreement and Provider’s Privacy Policy (which is incorporated herein by reference) constitute the entire Agreement and supersede any other agreements or understandings (oral or written) between you and Provider with respect to their subject matters unless you enter into a bespoke End User Licence Agreement or other Agreement regarding the Service which clearly states that it takes precedence and supersedes this Agreement.</p>
